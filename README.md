# **Rasa Driven Movie Recommendation Chatbot & Facial Emotion Detection**

## Overview
This project is divided into two parts:
- Part A: Development of a level 2/3 conversational movie recommendation chatbot using Rasa, with datasets, intents, and actions
- Part B: Development of a facial emotion detection system using the FER-2013 dataset

## Project Objectives
- Build, train, and evaluate a conversational AI chatbot using the Rasa framework.
- Develop a facial emotion detection model to classify emotions into categories using deep learning.
- Analyze, design, and present solutions with appropriate diagrams and metrics.

## Part A: Movie Recommendation Chatbot
### Description
The chatbot aims to provide intelligent conversational capabilities for providing movie recommendations to the user based on their request.
### Key Features
- Custom intents, entities, and actions for the problem domain.
- Training and validation using a custom dataset.
- Designed with UML diagrams (use case, sequence, and activity diagrams).
- Evaluation through testing
### Technologies Used
- Framework: Rasa
- Programming Language: Python
- Tools: NLU, Rasa core

## Part B: Facial Emotion Detection
### Descripton
The emotion detection system uses the FER-2013 dataset to clasify the emotions into distinct categories and is trained using deep learning.
### Key Features
- Image processing using the FER-2013 dataset converted to PNG format.
- Emotion classification.
- Evaluation using Precision, Recall, and F-measure.
### Technologies 
- Framework: Opencv
- Programming Language: Python
- Dataset: FER-2013

## Results & Evaluation
### Part A: Rasa Chatbot
The chatbot was tested multiple times and worked as per the expectations.
### Part B: Facial Emotion Detection
Evaluation Metrics are accessible through the code.
